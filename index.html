							<p class="major">I am Chemical Engineering and Business Student at RMIT. I am currently completing the 5th year of my 5 year double degree. I was born in Melbourne and have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from a small three year stint in New York. I can only speak english, but I know how to order wine in spanish (the important stuff...). An interesting fact about myself is that I play in a netball team that has only won about three games over three years.</p>

							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>Apart from some instances of using Chemical Engineering Programs, I have never really had much experiences with computers and programming. In fact I may be the only person at RMIT without a Laptop or Computer. However, I recently got a graduate job at Honeywell Process Solutions as a Project Engineer. Honeywell Process Solutions specialises in physical and software solutions for a range of plants and processes. They advised me it would be useful to have some software knowledge under my belt. Seeng as I had ZERO software knowledge, I thought I should try and learn a few points before starting.</p>
							<p>I was already completing my Chemical Engineering Degree here at RMIT, hence it made sense to complete my additional IT subjects here. I chose RMIT originally as it does have a different way of teaching and learning which really suits my style, and the people on this campus are really down to earth and lovely. I think this comes from being located in the city and incorporated with the real world as opposed to being in a seperate campus bubble.</p>
							<p>During this subject, I hope to learn some basic IT knowledge and to pick up on some of the lingo so I'm not totally lost when I start work. I would like to learn some of the basics of coding and generally some "tricks of the trade". So far, just listening in the tutorials and lectures has been a good learning experience.</p>

							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p>My ideal job is to be a Project Engineer at a large Oil & Gas company. The position as linked below is for a Senior Project Engineer at Suez Oil and Gas, who are an Engineering Procurement Company that design and build skids for the major Oil and Gas Companies. This job would be as a lead engineer in a team that designs, procures and builds skids. This job would involve working with a range of customers and involve a broad range of applications. This job is appealing to me as there would be a lot of learning and travelling involved, as well as meeting a wide range of people.</p>
							<p>This job requires 15+ years of experience in the field, to have good time management skills, team working skills, the ability to stay within a strict budget, to closely follow tight rules and regulations within customer's specifications, and being able to interact and excel in interations with both customer's and suppliers.</p>
							<p>Although I have far from 15 years of experience, the small amount of experience I have had in the feild has taught me how to get the most out of interactions with customers and suppliers, deal with short time frames, acheive tight budgets, and follow customer's specifications methodically. I have learnt team work from my time here at RMIT and my work in hospitality.</p>
							<p>To gain this experience I will take all opportunities given to me to work in different applications and to work in diffeent teams. I will continue to seek knowledge from those around me and talk to as many people I can. By starting at Honeywell, I will start to be exposed to a deeper understanding of the software behind processes and learn about industries I haven't been able to experience before. </p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<h3>Myer-Briggs Type Indicator Test</h3>
							<p>So this was actually a rip off test that was free called 16Personalities and the test results can be seen in the link below. My Personality type is "CONSUL" ESFJ-T which is the most common personaility and aligns with being popular. Although I do believe I am extroverted, I thought I used my thinking more than my feelings. In a team I am more likely to avoid conflict and keep people happy, rather than make the best decisions. I would need to ensure the group was balanced with people who are assertive so decisions can be made effectively. </p>

								<li><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-personality" class="button">16 Personalities Test Results</a></li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
							<p>I am an Auditory Learner which is unexpected as I usually write notes down to study. It shows that I should really attend lectures and tutorials to absorb the content through listening instead of notes. In a team, it would help me to discuss ideas with members and work through issues verbally with them. When selecting a team it may be helpful to have other auditory learners as then we can discuss as a group. </p>

							</ul>
							<h3>Verbal Reasoning Psychometric Test</h3>
							<p>The third test selected was a Verbal Reasoning Psychometric Test, which corresponds with the interprettation of information. I didn't belive this would be my strong point as I am better at figures than words, so I am happy with a score of 80%. This would mean I can interprete information reasonably accurately and should be clear on instructions, which should eliminate conflict in a group environment. When forming a team I could ensure my role is to edit tasks as I can appropriately analyse the work and criteria.</p>

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p> My project would be a centralised website for grad-program applications. The process of entering application after application can be incredibly tiresome and long winded. To cut out the re-entering of information, there should be a site that stores all your personal information/general question answers/resumes/cover letters/test results/Grades and automatically enter this information into grad applications. The site should alert users of relevant grad-programs like the Gradconnect website, but go a step further in terms of storing and automatically inputting your application information into the application. This means students will only have to enter data once and complete applications faster! </p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>The motivation came after my fellow students and I applied to 50 different graduate programs each with their own convoluted and difficult systems that involved hours of inputting data. The same information was required in each and every application with the exception of 1 or 2 questions; however the information never carried across. It made applications such a time consuming process and leaving many under graduates saying; THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY!! If there was a quicker way to input the information, there would be more time available to apply to more jobs and therefore higher chance of securing a job! </p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>The stakeholders involves will be the students and the Companies looking for graduates.</p>
							<p>The students would sign up to this page inputting email and linked in details so the programs are interconnected. The student will establish a profile that keeps a track of the applications that are active or interested in. The student would input all their data here including resume, cover letter, grades, work experience, generic information, and answers to some common application questions. This process will only have to complete once and never again.</p>
							<p>The Companies that are looking for graduate will either sign up for this page or have to be recruited to join this page. The companies will also have a profile that can be updated with the status or progress of the process. Their graduate program information will be inputted onto the site and a direct link to the application process. On this application process there will be a button or pop up option to auto-fill your information as is utilised on paypal and payment pages. This will automatically fill out the application so it is simple as just updating a few relevant points and submitting.</p>
							<p>Alongside this feature, there will be an additional feature that expands upon that of GradConnet and Whirlpool. There will be updates sent to students alerting of relevant graduate positions opening and warnings on closing dates as is utilised on GradConnect.  There will also be a page on the site that provides a record of all the applications completed and has live updates on the status of that applications (e.g. if its opened, closed, or inactive).</p>
							<p> Other uselful features may be discussion rooms for students, advertising spaces for company presentations and talks.</p>
